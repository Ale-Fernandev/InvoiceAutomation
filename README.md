* * In order for this to run in your system access the main file inside the dist folder and run that * *

I left comments all over the code and structured it so its easy to understand and edit. If you wish to use this for your own small business, feel free to fork it 
and make upgrades/changes as you wish.

invoice_template.docx is the template that the script accesses to make changes on. You can feel free to change the logo and style this template as you wish
the only thing that gets effected by code are the words in {{ }} or { }

if you felt this to be useful please be kind enough to star it :)

If there are any comments, additional implementations, feel free to share those with me <3
